# Biolife cafe
Web app to create an easy ordering system for internal coffee orders at Biolife Solutions.
---

## List of known bugs
- Temperature option (extra hot, light ice) doesn't work.
- DashboardDrinkTracker component doesn't render

## List of features to be added
- **Quick order/favorites system**
  
  These two systems should go hand in hand - edit favorites should allow users to create preset "favorite" drinks, which should show up in the quick order options to order with one or two buttons. (Quick order should also include the most recent order if the most recent order isn't already on the favorites)

- **Comments/notes option for drink orders**
  
  Should add a new option in drink ordering for additional comments that might not have an option in the ordering system. Maybe make a character limit to prevent spam.

- **Report a bug/suggest a new feature**
  
  Add a button to the dashboard that allows users to easily report bugs or suggest new features to be added. Would need a new db table for this.

- **Guest ordering**
  
  Index should add a new button for guests to order - that is, order without registering for an account. This ordering system should add a new option on the order screen for guest name.
